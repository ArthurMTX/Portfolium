# Dividends & Fees

The **Dividends & Fees** widget shows the total income you have received from **dividends**, together with the **total fees** you have paid on your trades.  
It helps you understand how much cash flow your investments have generated, and how much has been lost to commissions and charges.

---

## What It Shows

- The **total dividends received** for the active portfolio (main value)  
- The **total fees paid** (shown as a subtitle)  
- Both amounts displayed in your portfolio's currency  

This widget answers two questions:

> "How much income have my investments generated so far?"  
> "How much have I paid in fees to get that income and execute my trades?"

## How It's Calculated

Dividends & Fees are based on your recorded transactions.

**Formula (Dividends)**  

$$
\text{Total Dividends} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i
$$

Where:  
- $D_i$ = dividend amount for transaction *i* (cash received)

**Formula (Fees)**  

$$
\text{Total Fees} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} F_j
$$

Where:  
- $F_j$ = fee amount for transaction *j* (commissions, broker fees, etc.)

Additional notes:

- Only transactions explicitly marked as **dividends** contribute to *Total Dividends*  
- Only transactions marked as **fees** contribute to *Total Fees*  
- Both values are cumulative for the selected portfolio

## Example

Recorded transactions for your portfolio:

- Dividend from Asset A: €120.00  
- Dividend from Asset B: €80.00  
- Trading fees: €25.00  

Total Dividends:

$$
\text{Total Dividends} = 120 + 80 = 200
$$

Total Fees:

$$
\text{Total Fees} = 25
$$

The widget would display:

- Main value: **€200.00**
- Subtitle: **Fees: €25.00**

## When To Use It

The Dividends & Fees widget is useful for:

- Tracking the **income** generated by dividend-paying assets  
- Evaluating how much **fees eat into your returns**  
- Comparing dividend income with other sources of performance (price appreciation, realized P&L)  
- Monitoring long-term cash flow from your investments

## Notes

- Dividends and fees are based entirely on your recorded transactions  
- If you forget to log dividend or fee transactions, the widget will not reflect them  
- Currency and formatting follow your portfolio settings
