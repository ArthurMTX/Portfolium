# Total Return

The **Total Return** widget shows the **overall profit or loss** generated by your portfolio, combining all sources of performance into a single number.  
It answers the question:

> "How much have I made or lost in total with this portfolio, after dividends and fees?"

---

## What It Shows

- The **total monetary return** of your portfolio  
- Displayed in your portfolio's currency  
- Includes:

    - **Unrealized P&L** (open positions)
    - **Realized P&L** (closed trades)
    - **Dividends** received
    - **Fees** paid (as a negative component)

- Color-coded:

    - Green when total return is positive
    - Red when total return is negative  

The subtitle reminds you of the logic:  
**Unrealized + Realized + Dividends − Fees**

## How It's Calculated

Total Return combines market performance, income, and costs.

**Formula (Value)**

$$
\text{Total Return} =
P_{\text{unrealized}}
+ P_{\text{realized}}
+ D_{\text{dividends}}
- F_{\text{fees}}
$$

Where:

- $P_{\text{unrealized}}$ = total unrealized P&L on current positions  
- $P_{\text{realized}}$ = total realized P&L from closed positions  
- $D_{\text{dividends}}$ = total dividends received  
- $F_{\text{fees}}$ = total fees and commissions paid  

Additional notes:

- A **positive** Total Return means your portfolio has created value overall  
- A **negative** Total Return means losses and/or fees currently exceed gains and dividends  
- All values are cumulative for the selected portfolio

## Example

Assume your portfolio metrics are:

- Unrealized P&L: **+€1,200.00**  
- Realized P&L: **+€800.00**  
- Dividends: **+€150.00**  
- Fees: **€120.00**

Total Return:

$$
\text{Total Return} = 1\,200 + 800 + 150 - 120 = 2\,030
$$

The widget would display:

- **+€2,030.00** (in green)

## When To Use It

The Total Return widget is useful for:

- Getting a **single, global view** of your portfolio performance  
- Seeing how much **fees and dividends** affect your results  
- Complementing Unrealized and Realized P&L with a **net, all-in figure**  
- Checking whether your portfolio is creating value over the medium and long term

## Notes

- Total Return uses the same definitions as the **Unrealized P&L**, **Realized P&L**, **Dividends**, and **Fees** widgets
- It is shown as a **value**, not a percentage; for percentage performance, you can use other analytics such as **Insights** or performance charts  
- Results depend on your recorded transactions and up-to-date market prices
