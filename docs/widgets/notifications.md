# Notifications

The **Notifications** widget shows your most recent alerts related to your portfolio and activity in Portfolium.  
It provides a quick overview of important events without leaving the Dashboard.

---

## What It Shows

- A list of your **most recent notifications** (up to 5 items)  
- The **type** of each notification (price alert, daily change, transaction, system, etc.)  
- A **title** and short message describing what happened  
- The **time since** the notification was created (e.g. "30 minutes ago", "2 hours ago")  
- A visual indicator for **unread notifications**

This widget answers the question:  
> "What has recently happened in my portfolio that I should know about?"

---

## How It Works

- The widget automatically loads your latest notifications when it becomes visible on the Dashboard  
- **Unread** notifications are highlighted (background + small colored dot)  
- Clicking a notification marks it as **read**  
- The **"View All"** action opens the full Notifications page with the complete history  
- You can delete individual notifications using the **trash icon**

Additional notes:

- In some Dashboard layouts or during editing, a **preview mode** may show example notifications instead of your real data  
- When there are no notifications, an empty state is displayed instead of a list

## Example

Typical notifications you might see:

- **Price alert** - one of your assets reached a target price you defined  
- **Daily change** - your portfolio moved significantly up or down during the day  
- **Transaction summary** - confirmation of a recorded buy, sell, or other transaction 
- **System** - new login or important account activity 

Each notification shows:

- A small icon representing the type  
- A short title (e.g. "AAPL Price Alert", "AAPL Up 3.46%")  
- A message (e.g. "Apple reached your target price of $175")  
- A timestamp like "30 minutes ago" or "1 day ago"

## When To Use It

The Notifications widget is useful for:

- Staying informed about **important portfolio events** without checking emails or separate pages  
- Quickly reacting to **price alerts** or **large daily moves**  
- Tracking your recent **transactions** and **account activity**
- Keeping an eye on new activity while you work in other parts of the Dashboard  

---

## Notes

- The widget shows only the **most recent notifications**; older ones remain available on the full Notifications page  
- Deleting a notification removes it from both the widget and the Notifications page  
- The content and frequency of notifications depend on your portfolio activity and Portfolium's notification rules
