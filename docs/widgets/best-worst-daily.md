# Best & Worst Today

The **Best & Worst Today** widget highlights the **strongest gainer** and the **biggest loser** in your portfolio for the current trading day.  
It gives you an instant view of which positions are driving today's moves, both positively and negatively.

## What It Shows

For **today**, among your current positions with valid data, the widget displays:

- Your **best performer**:

    - Asset logo  
    - Symbol and name  
    - **Daily change (%)** in green with an up arrow  

- Your **worst performer**:

    - Asset logo  
    - Symbol and name  
    - **Daily change (%)** in red with a down arrow  

This widget answers the question:  
> "Which asset did the best today, and which one hurt me the most?"

---

## How It's Calculated

1. Start from all **current positions** in your portfolio.  
2. Among these positions:
   - The **best performer** is the one with the **highest daily change (%)**  
   - The **worst performer** is the one with the **lowest daily change (%)**

Additional notes:

- Daily change is based on **today's price move**, not total performance since purchase.  
- If there are not enough positions with valid data, the widget shows a **"No data available"** message.

## Example

Suppose your positions today have these daily changes:

- AAPL: **+3.40%**  
- MSFT: **+1.20%**  
- TSLA: **−4.80%**  
- NVDA: **+0.50%**

The widget would show:

- **Best performer**: AAPL, **+3.40%** (green card, up arrow)  
- **Worst performer**: TSLA, **−4.80%** (red card, down arrow)

## When To Use It

The Best & Worst Today widget is useful for:

- Quickly spotting which assets are **moving the most today**  
- Identifying positions that may deserve a closer look (news, earnings, macro events)  
- Tracking **daily volatility** in your portfolio  
- Complementing the **Daily Gain** and **Positions** widgets with a per-asset view

---

## Notes

- Values update according to your **price refresh settings** (auto-refresh or manual)  
- The widget only looks at **today's percentage change**, not position size; a small position can still appear as best or worst if its move is large  
- For impact in money terms, combine this widget with the **Positions** and **Daily Gain** widgets
