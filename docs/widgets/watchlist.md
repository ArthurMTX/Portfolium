# Watchlist

The **Watchlist** widget shows a compact view of the assets you are monitoring, without necessarily holding them in your portfolio.  
It lets you keep an eye on key symbols and their daily moves directly from the Dashboard.

## What It Shows

For each asset on your watchlist, the widget displays:

- **Symbol** (e.g. AAPL, AMZN, BTC-USD)  
- **Name** of the asset  
- **Current price**, in the asset's currency  
- **Daily percentage change**  
- The asset's **logo**, when it can be fetched (otherwise the symbol is shown)  

Only a limited number of items are shown (up to 5), so the widget stays readable and compact.

Each row gives you a quick summary of:

> "What is this asset trading at right now, and how much did it move today?"

---

## How It Works

- The widget retrieves the assets from your **main Watchlist** (same as the Watchlist page)  
- Prices and daily changes are updated regularly based on the latest market data  
- Positive daily changes are shown in **green** with an upward arrow  
- Negative daily changes are shown in **red** with a downward arrow  
- If the current price is unavailable, the widget displays **N/A** for that asset  

Clicking anywhere on a row opens the full **Watchlist** page, where you can:

- See the complete list of watchlist assets  
- Manage which symbols are tracked  
- View more detailed information

When there are no watchlist items, the widget shows an empty state message instead of an asset list.

## Example

For a typical watchlist, you might see entries like:

- **AMZN - Amazon.com Inc.**

    - Current price: $145.80  
    - Daily change: **+2.34%** (green, up arrow)

- **META - Meta Platforms Inc.**

    - Current price: $325.60  
    - Daily change: **-1.22%** (red, down arrow)

- **NFLX - Netflix Inc.**

    - Current price: $465.90  
    - Daily change: **+3.78%** (green, up arrow)

This allows you to quickly see which assets are moving the most during the day.

## When To Use It

The Watchlist widget is useful for:

- Monitoring assets you do **not** currently hold but are interested in  
- Keeping track of potential opportunities or future trades  
- Watching competitors or related assets alongside your portfolio  
- Getting a quick sense of market direction for your favourite symbols

## Notes

- The widget shows only a subset of your full Watchlist (most relevant or most recent items)
- To add or remove assets from your watchlist, use the dedicated **Watchlist** page  
- Prices and daily changes depend on market data availability and your refresh settings
