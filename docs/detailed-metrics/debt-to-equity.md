## Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)

### What It Shows
The **Debt-to-Equity ratio (D/E)** measures how much a company relies on **debt financing** compared to **shareholder equity**.

In simple terms:

> "For every \$1 of equity, how much debt does the company carry?"

This metric reveals a company's **financial leverage**, **risk level**, and **capital structure strategy**.

A low D/E suggests financial stability.  
A high D/E means the company is heavily leveraged and more exposed to interest-rate or liquidity risk.

Portfolium classifies companies into:

- **Low Leverage**
- **Moderate Leverage**
- **High Leverage**
- **Very High Leverage**

based on their D/E ratio.

### How It's Calculated

Portfolium fetches the value directly from yfinance's `debtToEquity` field.

The underlying formula (for your understanding) is:

$$
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = 
\frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholder Equity}}
$$

Where:

- **Total Debt** includes short-term + long-term borrowings.
- **Shareholder Equity** is assets minus liabilities.

Portfolium interprets the ratio using the following thresholds:

- **Low leverage:** $\text{D/E} < 50$
- **Moderate leverage:** $50 \le \text{D/E} < 100$
- **High leverage:** $100 \le \text{D/E} < 200$
- **Very high leverage:** $\text{D/E} \ge 200$

These categories generate the conclusion text under the metric card.

### Examples

#### Example 1 — Low Leverage

- Total Debt: $\$5B$  
- Shareholder Equity: $\$20B$  

$$
\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 = 25
$$

Portfolium classifies this as **Low Leverage**.

---

#### Example 2 — High Leverage

- Total Debt: $\$18B$  
- Shareholder Equity: $\$12B$  

$$
\frac{18}{12} = 1.5 = 150
$$

Portfolium classifies this as **High Leverage**.

---

#### Example 3 — Very High Leverage

- Total Debt: $\$10B$  
- Shareholder Equity: $\$2.5B$  

$$
\frac{10}{2.5} = 4 = 400
$$

Portfolium classifies this as **Very High Leverage**, indicating elevated risk.

### When To Use It

Use Debt-to-Equity to:

- **Evaluate risk** generated by borrowing  
  High leverage amplifies both gains and losses.
- **Assess financial stability**  
  Heavily indebted companies can face liquidity issues during downturns.
- **Compare firms within capital-intensive industries**  
  Utilities, telecom, and airlines normally carry higher D/E ratios.
- **Understand how the company funds growth**  
  Some firms borrow aggressively to expand; others rely on retained earnings.

It is especially useful for:

- analyzing long-term risk,
- judging dividend safety,
- screening for overleveraged companies,
- sector comparisons (since norms differ widely).

### Notes & Limitations

- **Industry-dependent metric**  
  High D/E may be normal in certain sectors (utilities, energy), but alarming in others (software, biotech).
- **Can be skewed by negative equity**  
  If shareholder equity is very low or negative, the D/E ratio becomes meaningless or extremely large.
- **Does not consider cash reserves**  
  A company with high debt *and* high cash may still be safe.  
  (Use **Net Cash**, **Current Ratio**, **Quick Ratio** alongside this metric.)
- **No timing information**  
  D/E does not tell you *when* debt matures—short-term debt is riskier.
- **Dependent on accounting practices**  
  Book equity may differ significantly from economic value.

Debt-to-Equity works best when combined with:

- **Net Cash Position**  
- **Current & Quick Ratios**  
- **Operating Margins**  
- **Free Cash Flow**  
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**
