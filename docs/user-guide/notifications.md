### Daily Change Notifications

Get alerted when your holdings experience significant price movements:

- **Daily Change Up** ðŸ“ˆ: Asset price increased significantly
- **Daily Change Down** ðŸ“‰: Asset price decreased significantly

### Price Alerts

Receive notifications when watchlist assets reach target prices:

- **Price Alert**: Asset hits your specified target price

2. All current notifications marked as read instantly

### Deleting Notifications

2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
3. Notification is permanently removed

!!! warning "Permanent Deletion"

### Filtering Notifications

Counts are displayed next to each filter option.

## Notification Settings

Configure your notification preferences in Settings â†’ Notifications.

### Daily Change Notifications

Get alerted when your holdings have significant price movements:

**Enable/Disable**

- Toggle daily change notifications on or off
- When enabled, you'll receive alerts for price movements
- When disabled, no daily change alerts are sent

**Notification Threshold**

Set the percentage change that triggers alerts:

- Default: 5%
- Range: 0% to 100%
- Example: 5% threshold triggers alerts when price moves up or down 5% or more

!!! tip "Threshold Recommendations"
    - **2-3%**: Very sensitive, many notifications (active trading)
    - **5%**: Balanced, significant movements only (default)
    - **10%+**: Only major price swings (long-term holding)

**How It Works**

1. Portfolium checks daily price changes for all your holdings
2. If any asset moves above your threshold, a notification is created
3. Shows both percentage change and dollar impact on your position
4. Separate notifications for increases (ðŸ“ˆ) and decreases (ðŸ“‰)

### Transaction Notifications

Get notified about portfolio transaction activity:

**Enable/Disable**

- Toggle transaction notifications on or off
- When enabled, you receive alerts for all transaction changes
- When disabled, no transaction alerts are sent

- Alert when you update an existing transaction
- Notice when a transaction is deleted

Each notification includes:
    - Transaction type (BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND, etc.)
    - Asset symbol and name
    - Quantity and price
    - Transaction date

## Understanding Notification Behavior

### When Notifications Are Created

**Transaction Notifications**

- Created immediately when you add, edit, or delete transactions
- One notification per transaction action
- Requires transaction notifications to be enabled

**Daily Change Notifications**

- Created during daily price update cycles
- One notification per asset per day (if threshold exceeded)
- Only for currently held positions (quantity > 0)
- Requires daily change notifications to be enabled

**Price Alerts**

- Created when watchlist asset hits target price
- Triggered during price updates
- Only if you have price alert enabled for the asset

**Login Notifications**

- Created each time you log in
- Helps you monitor account access
- Always created (cannot be disabled)

### Notification Timing

- **Immediate**: Transaction and login notifications
- **Periodic**: Daily change and price alerts (during price updates)
- **Batched**: No batching; notifications created as events occur

### Duplicate Prevention

- Same asset won't generate multiple daily change notifications on the same day
- Transaction notifications are unique per transaction action
- Login notifications are created per login session

## Best Practices

### Notification Settings

**Balance Your Preferences**

- Enable notifications for events you care about
- Set appropriate daily change threshold
- Don't set threshold too low (notification fatigue)

**Regular Review**

- Check notifications daily or weekly
- Mark read notifications to stay organized
- Delete old notifications you no longer need

### Managing Notification Volume

**Too Many Notifications?**

- Increase daily change threshold (5% â†’ 10%)
- Disable transaction notifications if you trade frequently
- Focus on significant events only

**Not Enough Notifications?**

- Lower daily change threshold (5% â†’ 2%)
- Enable all notification types
- Add price alerts to watchlist items

### Using Notifications Effectively

**Daily Change Alerts**

- Review why assets moved significantly
- Check news or market conditions
- Consider rebalancing if needed
- Track patterns over time

**Transaction Notifications**

- Verify transactions were recorded correctly
- Track your trading activity
- Review for unexpected changes

**Login Notifications**

- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Verify logins from new devices/locations
- Contact support if suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Notifications
