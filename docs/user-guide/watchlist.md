# Watchlist

Track assets you're interested in but don't own yet, set price alerts, and convert them to investments when ready.

## Overview

The Watchlist lets you monitor stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and other assets without actually owning them. It's perfect for researching potential investments, tracking market opportunities, and setting up price alerts. When you're ready to buy, convert watchlist items directly into portfolio transactions with one click.

## Accessing the Watchlist

1. Navigate to **Watchlist** in the main menu
2. View all assets you're tracking
3. Monitor current prices and daily changes
4. Manage alerts and notes for each asset

The Watchlist is independent of your portfolios‚Äîyou can track assets even before deciding which portfolio to add them to.

- Can disable alert to stop notifications

**Alert Status Display**

In the watchlist table:

- **Target price**: Shown in Alert column
- **Distance to target**: Percentage difference from current price
- **Green %**: Target is higher than current (upside potential)
- **Red %**: Target is lower than current (downside watch)

**Example**

```
Current Price: $150
Target Price: $175
Display: "$175 (+16.67%)"

Current Price: $150  
Target Price: $140
Display: "$140 (-6.67%)"
```

## Best Practices

### Research and Planning

**Build a Research Pipeline**

- Add interesting assets as you discover them
- Use notes to document investment thesis
- Set alerts at key technical levels
- Review watchlist regularly

**Organize with Notes**

- **Catalyst watching**: "Earnings on 2025-11-15"
- **Price targets**: "Buy if drops below $140"
- **Strategy fit**: "Dividend growth candidate"
- **Risk factors**: "High volatility, wait for confirmation"

**Prioritize Your Watchlist**

- Keep it manageable (20-50 items max)
- Delete assets you're no longer interested in
- Export old watchlists for archives
- Focus on high-conviction ideas

### Alert Strategy

**Set Meaningful Targets**

- **Support levels**: Buy at support

- **Valuation targets**: Fair value estimates
- **Stop losses**: Exit points for owned positions

**Multiple Alerts**

- Track same asset in watchlist for upside target
- Own in portfolio for downside protection
- Different strategies for different scenarios

**Review and Adjust**

- Update targets as market conditions change
- Disable irrelevant alerts
- Re-enable when conditions align again

### Conversion Workflow

5. **Track**: Monitor on Dashboard and in portfolio
6. **Decide**: Keep in watchlist or delete

**Pre-Purchase Checklist**

## Troubleshooting

### Assets Not Loading

**Solutions**

- Click Refresh to retry
- Verify ticker symbol is correct
- Wait and try again later
- Check if asset trades on supported exchanges

### Cannot Add Symbol

**"Already in Watchlist" Error**

- Intentional duplicate prevention

**Invalid Symbol**

- Ticker doesn't exist

- Verify ticker on Yahoo Finance first

### Alerts Not Triggering

**Check Alert Settings**

- Ensure alert is **Enabled**
- Verify target price is set
- Confirm price has actually crossed target
- Check Notifications page for alert

**Alert Timing**

- Alerts check during price refreshes

- Rapid price movements may miss exact target
- Manual refresh triggers alert check

### Import Failures

**File Format Issues**

- Ensure correct file extension (.csv or .json)
- Check for proper column headers in CSV
- Validate JSON syntax
- Save with UTF-8 encoding

**Data Validation Errors**

- Review error messages
- Fix invalid symbols
- Correct malformed prices
- Check true/false values for alert_enabled

**Partial Imports**

- Check warnings for skipped items
- Duplicates intentionally skipped
- Invalid rows ignored
- Successfully imported items added

### Conversion Problems

**Missing Portfolio Dropdown**

- Must have at least one portfolio
- Create portfolio first (see [Portfolios](portfolios.md))
- Refresh page after creating portfolio

**Price Pre-fill Incorrect**

- Shows cached price, may be stale
- Click Refresh on main watchlist first
- Override with actual purchase price
- Use current market price from broker
