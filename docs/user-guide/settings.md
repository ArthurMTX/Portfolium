# Settings

Customize Portfolium to match your preferences and workflow.

## Overview

The Settings page allows you to configure application behavior, notification preferences, validation rules, and manage your data. Settings are organized into four tabs for easy navigation.

## Accessing Settings

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the navigation menu
2. Or navigate to Settings from your user profile dropdown
3. Select the tab for the settings you want to adjust

## General Settings

Configure application-wide preferences and features.

### Auto-Refresh Settings

Control automatic price updates for your portfolio dashboard:

**Enable/Disable Auto-Refresh**

- Toggle automatic price refresh on or off
- When enabled, prices update automatically at your chosen interval
- When disabled, prices only update manually or on page load

**Refresh Interval**

Choose how often prices update automatically:

- **15 seconds**: Very frequent (testing only)
- **30 seconds**: Frequent updates
- **1 minute**: Default, good balance
- **2 minutes**: Moderate updates
- **5 minutes**: Less frequent
- **10 minutes**: Minimal API usage

!!! tip "Refresh Interval Recommendations"
    - **Active trading**: 30 seconds - 1 minute
    - **Regular monitoring**: 1-2 minutes
    - **Casual tracking**: 5-10 minutes
    - Shorter intervals use more API quota

**How It Works**

- Auto-refresh can also be toggled from the Dashboard (lightning bolt button)
- Prices refresh automatically when you return to the browser tab
- Settings are saved to your browser (local storage)
- Each user can have their own refresh preferences

**Settings Location**

Changes are saved instantly to your browser's local storage and persist across sessions.

## Notification Settings

Configure what notifications you receive and when. See [Notifications](notifications.md) for detailed information about notification types.

### Daily Change Notifications

Get alerted when your holdings have significant price movements:

**Enable Daily Change Notifications**

- Toggle daily change notifications on or off
- Receive alerts for both upward ðŸ“ˆ and downward ðŸ“‰ movements
- Notifications created during daily price check (9:00 AM)

**Notification Threshold**

Set the percentage that triggers alerts:

- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 5%
- **Increment**: 0.5%
- Applies to both positive and negative changes

**How It Works**

- System checks holdings daily at 9:00 AM
- Compares current price to previous day's close
- Creates notifications for changes exceeding threshold
- Separate notifications for each affected asset
- Shows percentage change and dollar impact on your position

### Transaction Notifications

Get notified about transaction activity:

**Enable Transaction Notifications**

- Toggle transaction notifications on or off
- Receive alerts when you create, update, or delete transactions
- Helps track all portfolio activity

**What You'll Receive**

- New transaction notifications (BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND, etc.)
- Transaction update notifications
- Transaction deletion notifications
- Each includes asset symbol, quantity, price, and date

### Saving Notification Settings

After adjusting notification preferences:

1. Click **Save Notification Settings** button
2. Settings are saved to your user account
3. Success message confirms update
4. Changes take effect immediately for future notifications

!!! note "Account-Wide Settings"
    Notification settings are saved to your user account and apply across all devices where you're logged in.

## Validation Settings

Control transaction validation rules and data integrity checks.

### Sell Quantity Validation

Prevent selling more shares than you own:

**Enable Validation**

- When enabled: Cannot sell more shares than current position
- When disabled: Can sell any quantity (useful for imports)
- Default: Enabled

**When to Disable**

- Importing historical transactions out of chronological order
- Recording short selling positions
- Fixing data entry errors temporarily
- Advanced scenarios requiring flexibility

**When to Enable**

- Normal transaction entry
- Preventing accidental overselling
- Ensuring data integrity
- Maintaining accurate position tracking

!!! warning "Runtime Changes Only"
    Changes to validation settings take effect immediately but are **not persisted** across server restarts. To make permanent changes, update the `VALIDATE_SELL_QUANTITY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

**Error Messages**

When validation is enabled and you try to sell too many shares:

```
Cannot sell X shares of SYMBOL.
Current position: Y shares.
(This check can be disabled in settings: VALIDATE_SELL_QUANTITY=false)
```

This error protects you from accidentally creating invalid positions.

## Danger Zone

Critical operations that permanently affect your data.

!!! danger "Irreversible Actions"
    Operations in the Danger Zone **cannot be undone**. Deleted data is permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

### Delete All Data

Permanently remove all portfolio data from your account:

**What Gets Deleted**

- All transactions (BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND, etc.)
- All price history data
- All portfolios
- All assets
- User account remains active

**How to Delete**

1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Danger Zone
2. Type `delete` in the confirmation field (case-insensitive)
3. Click **Delete all data** button
4. Data is immediately removed

**After Deletion**

- Your user account remains active
- You can log in and create new portfolios
- All historical data is gone
- Notification history is preserved
- Settings return to defaults

**Confirmation Required**

- Must type exactly "delete" to enable the button
- Prevents accidental deletion
- Irreversible once confirmed

!!! tip "Before Deleting"
    Consider exporting your data first:
    
    1. Go to Transactions page
    2. Click **Export** to download CSV
    3. Save the CSV file as a backup
    4. You can re-import later if needed

**Use Cases**
