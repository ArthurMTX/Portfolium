# Portfolios

Learn how to create and manage your investment portfolios.

## Overview

Portfolios are organizational containers for your investments. Each portfolio represents a distinct collection of assets and transactions, allowing you to track different investment strategies, accounts, or goals separately. Create as many portfolios as you need to organize your financial life.

## Creating a Portfolio

Set up a new portfolio to start tracking your investments:

1. Navigate to the **Portfolios** page from the main menu
2. Click the **Create Portfolio** button
3. Fill in the portfolio details:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for easy identification (required)
    - **Currency**: Base currency for valuations (default: EUR)
    - **Description**: Optional notes about the portfolio's purpose
4. Click **Create** to save

!!! tip "Multiple Portfolios for Organization"
    Create unlimited portfolios to separate your investments by strategy, account type, or any criteria that helps you stay organized.

## Managing Portfolios

### Viewing All Portfolios

Access your portfolios from:

- **Portfolios** page: Shows all portfolios in a list
- **Dashboard**: Select active portfolio from dropdown
- **Most pages**: Portfolio selector in the navigation or header

### Switching Active Portfolio

Most pages show data for one portfolio at a time (the "active" portfolio):

1. Look for the portfolio dropdown selector
2. Click to see your portfolio list
3. Select the portfolio you want to view
4. The page updates to show that portfolio's data

Your active portfolio selection persists as you navigate between pages.

### Editing a Portfolio

Update portfolio details as your needs change:

1. Navigate to the **Portfolios** page
2. Find the portfolio you want to edit
3. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
4. Modify the details:
    - **Name**: Update the descriptive name
    - **Currency**: Change the base currency
    - **Description**: Update or add notes
5. Click **Save Changes**

!!! warning "Currency Changes"
    Changing a portfolio's currency does not convert existing transaction values. Historical transactions remain in their original currency, but new valuations will use the new currency.

### Deleting a Portfolio

Permanently remove a portfolio and all its data:

1. Navigate to the **Portfolios** page
2. Find the portfolio you want to delete
3. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

!!! danger "Irreversible Deletion"
    Deleting a portfolio **permanently removes**:
    
    - All transactions in the portfolio
    - All calculated positions and metrics
    - All historical data
    
    This action **cannot be undone**. Export your transactions first if you want to preserve the data.

**Before Deleting**

Consider these alternatives:

- **Export transactions** as CSV for backup
- **Keep the portfolio** but don't add new transactions
- **Create a new portfolio** instead of deleting the old one

## Portfolio Data and Privacy

### Data Ownership

- All portfolio data belongs to your user account
- Other users cannot see your portfolios
- Each portfolio is isolated from others

### Data Storage

- Portfolio metadata (name, currency, description)
- All transactions associated with the portfolio
- Calculated positions and metrics (regenerated on demand)
- Historical price data (shared across portfolios for the same assets)

### Multi-Portfolio Assets

If you own the same asset in multiple portfolios:

- Each portfolio tracks its own positions independently
- Transactions are separate between portfolios
- Metrics are calculated per portfolio
- Price data is shared (one fetch benefits all portfolios)

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Be Descriptive**

- Use clear, meaningful names
- Include account type or purpose
- Add year or timeframe if relevant

**Good Examples**

- "Vanguard IRA - Retirement"
- "Active Trading 2025"
- "ETRADE - Long Term"
- "Crypto Portfolio"
- "Paper Trading - Tech Stocks"

**Avoid**

- Generic names like "Portfolio 1"
- Very long names that get truncated
- Names that don't distinguish portfolios

### Organization Strategies

**Start Simple**

- Begin with one or two portfolios
- Add more as your needs grow
- Don't over-organize initially

**Mirror Real Accounts**

- Create one portfolio per brokerage account
- Easier to reconcile with real statements
- Simplifies tax reporting

**Separate Strategies**

- Keep different investment approaches separate
- Compare performance between strategies
- Easier to rebalance within each strategy

**Regular Maintenance**

- Review portfolios periodically
- Archive or delete unused portfolios
- Export data before major changes
- Keep descriptions up to date
