# Charts

Visualize your portfolio performance over time with interactive charts and allocation heatmaps.

## Overview

The Charts page provides visual representations of your portfolio's value history and asset allocation. Use charts to spot trends, understand composition, and track performance over different time periods. Visual data helps you make informed decisions and quickly identify patterns in your investments.

## Accessing Charts

1. Navigate to **Charts** in the main menu
2. Ensure you have an active portfolio selected
3. Verify you have transactions in your portfolio
4. View your portfolio visualizations

!!! note "Requires Transaction Data"
    Charts require at least one transaction in your portfolio. If you see an empty state, add transactions first by visiting the [Transactions](transactions.md) page.

## Portfolio Heatmap

The heatmap shows your current asset allocation as a visual treemap.

### What It Shows

**Visual Asset Allocation**

- Each rectangle represents one asset
- Size proportional to market value
- Larger boxes = bigger positions
- Smaller boxes = smaller positions
- All holdings visible at once

**Color Coding by Performance**

The heatmap uses color to show each asset's performance:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green shades**: Positive P&L (profits)
- ðŸ”´ **Red shades**: Negative P&L (losses)
- **Color intensity**: Stronger = bigger percentage gain/loss
- **Neutral gray**: Break-even positions (~0% P&L)

**Position Details**

Each tile displays:

- **Symbol**: Asset ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
- **Percentage**: Portfolio allocation (e.g., 25.3%)
- **Market Value**: Current position value
- **P&L %**: Performance percentage

### Understanding the Layout

**Size and Position**

- Largest holdings appear first (top-left)
- Smaller holdings fill remaining space
- Grid-based layout for clean organization
- Responsive to screen size

**Tile Sizes**

- â‰¥20% holdings: Large tiles (50% width)
- 12-20% holdings: Medium tiles (33% width)
- 8-12% holdings: Medium-small tiles (25% width)
- 5-8% holdings: Small tiles (25% width)
- 2.5-5% holdings: Extra-small tiles (16% width)
- <2.5% holdings: Tiny tiles (16% width)

### Interpreting the Heatmap

**Diversification Check**

- One or two giant boxes? â†’ Concentrated portfolio
- Many medium boxes? â†’ Well-diversified
- Lots of tiny boxes? â†’ Over-diversified or many small positions
- Balance depends on your strategy

**Performance Overview**

- Mostly green? â†’ Portfolio performing well
- Mostly red? â†’ Portfolio underperforming
- Mixed colors? â†’ Some winners, some losers
- Bright green in large box? â†’ Big winner driving returns
- Bright red in large box? â†’ Big loser dragging down portfolio

**Allocation Analysis**

- Compare tile sizes to your target allocation
- Identify positions that have grown too large
- Spot positions that may need rebalancing
- Visualize sector/asset concentration

!!! tip "Rebalancing Indicator"
    If one position grows much larger than intended, the heatmap makes it obvious. Use this visual cue to decide when to rebalance.

### Use Cases

**Portfolio Construction**

- Verify allocation matches your strategy
- Check for over-concentration
- Identify diversification gaps
- Plan new purchases

**Risk Management**

- Hover cursor over chart line
- Tooltip appears with:
    - Exact date
    - Portfolio value at that date
    - Formatted currency amount
- Move along timeline to explore history

**Tooltip Information**

- **Date**: Precise date/time of data point

### Historical Data Points

**How Data is Calculated**

For each date, the chart shows:

```
Portfolio Value = Î£ (Holdings Quantity Ã— Price on that Date)
```

**Includes**

- All buy transactions up to that date
- All sell transactions up to that date
- Stock split adjustments
- Historical prices for each holding

**Excludes**

- Dividends (added separately to metrics)
- Fees (tracked separately)
- Unrealized P&L from sold positions (realized separately)

!!! note "Historical Price Availability"
    Chart accuracy depends on historical price data availability. Some assets may not have complete history, showing gaps in the chart.

## Backfill History Feature

Populate missing historical price data for better chart accuracy.

### What Is Backfilling?

**Purpose**

- Fetches historical daily prices for all portfolio assets
- Fills gaps in price history
- Enables accurate historical value calculations
- Improves chart completeness

**When to Use**

- After adding old transactions with past dates
- When importing historical data
- If chart shows gaps or missing data
- To complete portfolio history

### How to Backfill

**Running Backfill**

1. Navigate to the Charts page
2. Click **Backfill History** button
3. Wait for process to complete
4. See status message with results
5. Chart updates automatically

**What Happens**

- System identifies all assets in your portfolio
- Fetches daily prices for past 365 days (configurable)
- Saves price data to database
- Calculates historical portfolio values
- Updates chart with new data

**Backfill Results**

Status message shows:

- Number of assets processed
- Price points saved per asset
- Success/failure indication
- Any errors encountered

**Example Output**

```
Backfilled 5 assets. Saved: AAPL: 365, MSFT: 365, GOOGL: 365, TSLA: 250, BTC-USD: 365
```

This means:

- 5 assets in portfolio
- Most have 365 days of data
- TSLA only has 250 days (maybe newer position or data gap)

### Backfill Considerations

**Time to Complete**

- Depends on number of assets
- More assets = longer process
- Typically completes in 10-30 seconds
- Progress shown during processing

**API Rate Limits**

- Uses Yahoo Finance API
- Subject to rate limits
- Multiple assets fetched sequentially
- May fail if rate limited

**Data Quality**

- Historical data from Yahoo Finance
- Some assets may have incomplete history
- Delisted stocks may have gaps
- Crypto may have shorter history

**When It Fails**

If backfill fails:

- Check error message for details
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Verify asset symbols are valid
- Some assets may not have full history
- Network issues may cause failure

!!! tip "Run Backfill Sparingly"
    Backfill is resource-intensive. Run it only when needed (after bulk imports or when historical data is missing), not regularly.
