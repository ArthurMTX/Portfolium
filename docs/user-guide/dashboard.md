# Dashboard

Monitor your portfolio performance in real-time with live metrics and position tracking.

## Overview

The Dashboard is your central command center for tracking portfolio performance. It provides real-time price updates, key performance metrics, and detailed position information all in one place. Use the Dashboard to get a quick overview of your investments and monitor daily changes.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to Portfolium
2. Click **Dashboard** in the main navigation
3. Select your active portfolio from the dropdown
4. View your real-time portfolio data

The Dashboard is typically your landing page after login, giving you immediate access to your portfolio status.

## Key Metrics Cards

The Dashboard displays four essential metrics at the top of the page:

### Total Value

**What It Shows**

- Current market value of all holdings
- Sum of (quantity Ã— current price) for all positions
- Excludes sold positions
- Updates with latest prices

**Calculation**

```
Total Value = Î£ (Position Quantity Ã— Current Price)
```

**When to Monitor**

- Daily portfolio check-ins
- Before making investment decisions
- Tracking portfolio growth over time
- Comparing to your investment goals

### Unrealized P&L (Profit & Loss)

**What It Shows**

- Profit or loss on your current holdings
- Difference between current value and cost basis
- Percentage return on investment
- Updates in real-time with prices

**Calculation**

```
Unrealized P&L = Total Value - Total Cost
Unrealized P&L % = (Unrealized P&L / Total Cost) Ã— 100
```

**Color Coding**

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Positive (profit)
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Negative (loss)
- Includes both dollar amount and percentage

**Understanding Unrealized**

"Unrealized" means you still hold the positions. The gain/loss is "on paper" until you sell.

### Realized P&L

**What It Shows**

- Actual profit or loss from completed sales
- Based on historical sell transactions
- Does not include current holdings
- Permanent record of past performance

**Calculation**

```
Realized P&L = Î£ (Sale Proceeds - Cost Basis) for all sells
```

**When It Updates**

- When you record SELL transactions
- After processing stock splits
- When dividends are factored in

**Use Cases**

- Tax planning and reporting
- Evaluating past trading decisions
- Tracking total returns over time
- Performance reporting

### Dividends & Fees

**What It Shows**

- **Dividends**: Total dividend income received
- **Fees**: Total transaction fees and commissions paid

- Cumulative over portfolio lifetime

**Tracking Income**

- Monitor dividend yield
- Calculate total income from investments
- Track fee impact on returns
- Evaluate cost efficiency

!!! tip "Net Returns"
    For true performance, consider: Unrealized P&L + Realized P&L + Dividends - Fees

2. Choose interval from dropdown
3. Setting saves automatically
4. Applies when auto-refresh is enabled

    - **Active trading**: 30 seconds - 1 minute
    - **Regular monitoring**: 1-2 minutes  
    - **Casual tracking**: 5-10 minutes
    - Shorter intervals use more API quota

### How Auto-Refresh Works

**Automatic Behavior**

- Updates pause when browser tab is hidden
- Resumes when you return to the tab
- One immediate refresh when tab becomes visible
- Saves settings to browser local storage

- Useful for immediate updates
- Resets the auto-refresh countdown

## Sold Positions Table

Track your historical trading performance:

### Viewing Sold Positions

**Accessing the Tab**

3. View assets you've completely sold

**What Counts as Sold**

```

**No Current Price**

Sold positions don't show current prices because you no longer own them. The performance is locked in based on your sale.

### Lazy Loading

**Performance Optimization**

- Reduces initial page load time
- Data is cached after first load
- Switches between tabs are instant after loading

**Loading Indicator**

If loading takes a moment, you'll see:

- Spinner animation
- "Loading sold positions..." message

### Empty Sold Positions

**No Sold Positions Yet**

If you see an empty state:

- Partial sales don't appear here
- Only complete position closures show
- Start shows up after first complete sell

!!! note "Partial Sales vs Full Sales"
    Partially selling shares (selling some but not all) keeps the asset in Current Positions with reduced quantity. Only when you sell ALL shares does it move to Sold Positions.

4. Try manual refresh instead of auto-refresh
5. Reduce auto-refresh frequency if rate limited
